# Dissertation - Toolbox of automatic visual inspection solutions

**PROJECT:** 

The objective of this work is to develop a toolbox of configurable solutions, through a graphical interface appropriate to the problem, so that they can be applied to similar problems. This dissertation focuses on the detection of four specific problems, namely, the detection of fiducial markers, the detection of pins, the detection of the geometric center and verification of the positioning of pointers and the detection of the absence or defective positioning of screws.

The methods proposed for each of the problems were based on the operators provided by the Halcon software and validated on different objects. The developed methods proved to be efficient, being able to correctly detect the objects.

The developed application focuses on the definition of micro-operations and the execution engine. It is the combination of the interactive mode of the application, with the parameterizable toolbox, that enables the user
configure the solutions.

**OBJECTIVES:**
* Detection and recognition of different fiducial markers to, for example, help locate other electronic components inserted in plates;
* Detection of pins correctly positioned on plugs;
* Detection of the geometric center of objects for the placement of pointers and respective verification of their correct positioning;
* Detection of the absence or defective positioning of screws;
* The solutions developed will also be configurable, so that they can be applied to other problems with different properties.


**RESULTS:**
